# othelloSDL3
This is work in progress
As of now the game logic has been implemented (iterativly this time, unlike the ADA version) and is fully functional
I still haven't made a win condition

## TODO
- implement a win condition
- sounds
- figure out how to make a menu
- make a single player version versus a bot
- then figure out how to make the bot competent???

 # HOW TO RUN
 You need to add the SDL3.dll into the same folder as the .exe file <br>
 SDL3.dll can found here: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases
